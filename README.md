# Example_AdvFun_LocalGroup
Example script: Advanced Function to list user in Admin Group

Before writing the script or function, write the test script first based on how the commend will work

In this example we will be connecting to localHost and/or Remote Servers.  So we createda mock function to test for vaild connection types. Like Short Server Name, Fully Qualified Domain Name or IP Address.
